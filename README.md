Major Data Structure problems and Algorithms

This project contains major algorithms based on data structures like arrays, queue, stack, list, array list, linked list, hash map, tree map, trees, binary trees etc.

This also contains major algorithms on different strategies like recursion, dynamic programming, backtracking, divide and conquer etc.

This also contains major algorithms and problems based on queues, stacks, trees, threads, executor frameworks, exception handling etc.

This project contains the problems related the different concepts in java 8 like streams, flat map, partitioning, joining, concurrent map, concurrency, multi-threading, executor frameworks, string manipulations, file NIO, file NIO2, lambda operators, functional programming, data and time formatting, filter, reduce and collect, parallel programming, reactive streams, parallel streams, statistics, accumulators, publish and subscribe, group by and limit etc.
