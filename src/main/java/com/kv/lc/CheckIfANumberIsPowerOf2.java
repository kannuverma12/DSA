 *  Check if a given number is a power of 2
 *  
 *  
 *  There is one more way we can go about it. Suppose we have to check for number 8. 8= 1000 and 8â€“1=7=0111
 *  if we AND the number with number-1, we will get 0, as in the above case.
 *  But if number=3, number-1=2
 *  3=11 and 2=10, 11 & 10 = 10 != 0
 *  Conclusion: Number is power of 2 if Number & (Number-1)==0
